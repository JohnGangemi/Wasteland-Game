# Wasteland-Game
Started this project after finishing a course on program design using the C language. It hasn't been touched in years and could use some refining. I tried to make use of dynamic memory allocation and linked-lists data structures when possible.

###Future Goals
- Implement a dynamic file save/load system, err fix what's there already
- Pretty up the interface
- Tweak overall program structure

###Ports
I would eventually like to port this game to a cross-platform framework with a GUI but still keep the text based interaction just add art and a menu system.
